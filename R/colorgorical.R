#' @title  Create a colorgorical palette
#' @description An interface for creating palettes from
#'   \href{http://vrl.cs.brown.edu/color/}{colorgorical}.
#'
#' @param n Number of color values to return.
#' @param perceptualDifference Value from 0 to 1. See details.
#' @param nameDifference Value from 0 to 1. See details.
#' @param nameUniqueness Value from 0 to 1. See details.
#' @param pairPreference Value from 0 to 1. See details.
#' @param hueFilters  Must be given as an element of a list. See details.
#' @param lightnessRange See details.
#' @param startPalette A starting point for the color as a vector of 3 CIE Lab
#'   values. Must be given as an element of a list. See details.
#' @param output Character string. Output may be given as LAB, sRGB, or HEX
#'   values. If 'LAB' or 'sRGB', a matrix of those values where each row
#'   represents a color. If 'HEX', the default, a character vector of hex values
#'   is returned.
#'
#' @details This function accesses the colorgorical website to create a color
#'   palette. It requires two other packages to work: \code{httr} and
#'   \code{jsonlite}, and if you want a hex value, \code{colorspace}.
#'
#'   The following are relevant parts from the descriptions at the website.
#'
#'   \bold{Perceptual Distance}: Increasing Perceptual Distance favors palette
#'   colors that are more easily discriminable to the human eye. To accurately
#'   model human color acuity, this is performed using CIEDE2000 in CIE Lab
#'   color space.
#'
#'   \bold{Name Difference}: Increasing Name Difference favors palette colors
#'   that share few common names. This is similar to perceptual distance, but
#'   can lead to different results in certain areas of color space. This happens
#'   when there are many different names for perceptually close colors (e.g.,
#'   red and pink are perceptually close but named differently). Colorgorical
#'   calculates this using Heer and Stone's Name Difference function, which is
#'   built on top of the XKCD color-name survey.
#'
#'   \bold{Pair Preference}: Increasing Pair Preference favors palette colors
#'   that are, on average, predicted to be more aesthetically preferable
#'   together. Typically these colors are similar in hue, have different
#'   lightness, and are cooler colors (blues and greens). Pair Preference is
#'   based off of Schloss and Palmer's research on color preference.
#'
#'   \bold{Name Uniqueness}: Increasing Name Uniqueness favors palette colors
#'   that are uniquely named. Some colors like red are readily named and are
#'   favored, whereas other colors are less obviously named and are ignored.
#'   Like, Name Difference, Name Uniqueness is based on Heer and Stone's
#'   color-name research.
#'
#'   \bold{Select hue filter}: You can limit which colors are selected by either
#'   dragging over the wheel to select a hue range, or by entering the angles
#'   manually (e.g., select only reds). You can also make multiple selections
#'   after one another to select many different hue ranges (e.g., select both
#'   greens and purples).
#'
#'   \bold{Select lightness range}: You can change whether Colorgorical samples
#'   lighter or darker colors.
#'
#'   \bold{Add starting colors}: You can guarantee that certain colors are in
#'   your palette. Note, as near as I can tell, it is only guaranteed if you
#'   have already created a palette at the website and start with one of the
#'   generated colors. Otherwise, it appears to pick something close to the
#'   starting point(s) given the settings. See the example.
#'
#'   NOTE: Because JSON is being used behind the scenes, for \code{hueFilters}
#'   and \code{startPalette}, the values must be given as a list.
#'
#'   For example:
#'
#'   \code{hueFilters = list(c(90, 180))}
#'
#'   \code{startPalette = list(c(59, 62, 70))}
#'
#' The R code is based on the gist by Kamil Slowikowski found here:
#' \href{https://gist.github.com/slowkow/22daea426607416bfcd573ce9cbd89ab}{link}.
