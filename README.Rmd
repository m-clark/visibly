Visibly is a handful of functions I use for color palettes, themes, etc. in R.  Inside you will find:

- some ready-made palettes, e.g. based on R blue and Stan red
- a function to quickly and easily create palettes with using `colortools::complementary` `colortools::adjacent` etc. 
- clean, web-friendly themes for ggplot2 and plotly
- a function to interact with [colorgorical](http://vrl.cs.brown.edu/color/)

## Installation
The development version then install directly from GitHub:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("m-clark/visibly")
```

Visibly is currently in its very early stages, so more may be added soon.  For some additional palettes for those fond of another time, you might be interested in [NineteenEightyR](https://github.com/m-clark/NineteenEightyR).
