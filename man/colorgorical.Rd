\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of color values to return.}

\item{perceptualDifference}{Value from 0 to 1. See details.}

\item{nameDifference}{Value from 0 to 1. See details.}

\item{nameUniqueness}{Value from 0 to 1. See details.}

\item{pairPreference}{Value from 0 to 1. See details.}

\item{hueFilters}{Must be given as an element of a list. See details.}

\item{lightnessRange}{See details.}

\item{startPalette}{A starting point for the color as a vector of 3 CIE Lab
values. Must be given as an element of a list. See details.}

\item{output}{Character string. Output may be given as LAB, sRGB, or HEX
values. If 'LAB' or 'sRGB', a matrix of those values where each row
represents a color. If 'HEX', the default, a character vector of hex values
is returned.}

\description{
An interface for creating palettes from
  \href{http://vrl.cs.brown.edu/color/}{colorgorical}.
}
\details{
This function accesses the colorgorical website to create a color
  palette. It requires two other packages to work: \code{httr} and
  \code{jsonlite}, and if you want a hex value, \code{colorspace}.

  The following are relevant parts from the descriptions at the website.

  \bold{Perceptual Distance}: Increasing Perceptual Distance favors palette
  colors that are more easily discriminable to the human eye. To accurately
  model human color acuity, this is performed using CIEDE2000 in CIE Lab
  color space.

  \bold{Name Difference}: Increasing Name Difference favors palette colors
  that share few common names. This is similar to perceptual distance, but
  can lead to different results in certain areas of color space. This happens
  when there are many different names for perceptually close colors (e.g.,
  red and pink are perceptually close but named differently). Colorgorical
  calculates this using Heer and Stone's Name Difference function, which is
  built on top of the XKCD color-name survey.

  \bold{Pair Preference}: Increasing Pair Preference favors palette colors
  that are, on average, predicted to be more aesthetically preferable
  together. Typically these colors are similar in hue, have different
  lightness, and are cooler colors (blues and greens). Pair Preference is
  based off of Schloss and Palmer's research on color preference.

  \bold{Name Uniqueness}: Increasing Name Uniqueness favors palette colors
  that are uniquely named. Some colors like red are readily named and are
  favored, whereas other colors are less obviously named and are ignored.
  Like, Name Difference, Name Uniqueness is based on Heer and Stone's
  color-name research.

  \bold{Select hue filter}: You can limit which colors are selected by either
  dragging over the wheel to select a hue range, or by entering the angles
  manually (e.g., select only reds). You can also make multiple selections
  after one another to select many different hue ranges (e.g., select both
  greens and purples).

  \bold{Select lightness range}: You can change whether Colorgorical samples
  lighter or darker colors.

  \bold{Add starting colors}: You can guarantee that certain colors are in
  your palette. Note, as near as I can tell, it is only guaranteed if you
  have already created a palette at the website and start with one of the
  generated colors. Otherwise, it appears to pick something close to the
  starting point(s) given the settings. See the example.

  NOTE: Because JSON is being used behind the scenes, for \code{hueFilters}
  and \code{startPalette}, the values must be given as a list.

  For example:

  \code{hueFilters = list(c(90, 180))}

  \code{startPalette = list(c(59, 62, 70))}

The R code is based on the gist by Kamil Slowikowski found here:

\examples{
\dontrun{
library(visibly)
colorgorical(n = 12, pairPreference = 1, startPalette = list(c(10, -60, 45)))

# go from hex to lab to use single starting point, but see note about
starting colors
col = t(col2rgb(palettes$Rblue$Rblue))
col = convertColor(col, from = "sRGB", to = "Lab", scale.in = 255)[1,]
testcol = colorgorical(n=12, pairPreference = 1, startPalette = list(col))
testcol = c(palettes$Rblue$Rblue, testcol)
ggplot2::qplot(x=factor(testcol, levels = testcol),
               y=1:12,
               color=I(testcol),
               size=I(10))
}
