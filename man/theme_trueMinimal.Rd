\title{Clean visualizations}
\usage{
theme_trueMinimal()

theme_plotly(vis, MB = FALSE)

theme_blank(vis, MB = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{vis}{A plotly, or ggvis}

\item{MB}{For plotly, an option to dispaly the mode bar. Defaults to FALSE.}
}
\description{
Clean up plots from their defaults.
}
\details{
From a gray background, to unnecessary gridlines, to by-default
  reference lines, some of the more popular visualization packages come out
  75% fantastic and 25% wtf?.  These functions remove unnecessary gridlines,
  'de-bold' the blacks, etc. **ggplot2**: This function takes a ggplot object
  and removes the gray background, gridlines and adds opacity to the default
  black axes and labels, allowing the pattern of the visual to be expressed
  in unimpeded fashion.

  Plotly will put reference lines at zero, and some of its 'modebar' is
  unnecessary.  Otherwise little is changed at this point, except for
  theme_blank, which is like theme_void for ggplot.
