<p>The palette creator can create some decent categorical distinctions without too much fuss. The following also demonstrates one of the themes, which has no grid/gray, and de-bolds the black font while leaving text clear; even the fainter version will pass web standards for contrast against a white background. As shown, you can still fiddle with the theme beyond that.</p>

<p><img src="intro_files/figure-html/use2-1.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Another way to create palettes is with a function that works with <a href="http://vrl.cs.brown.edu/color">colorgorical</a>. It connects to that website to create colors based on things like whether they perceptually go together aesthetically, whether they are more or less perceptually distinct, or even if their name is unique.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-1" data-line-number="1">## colorgorical(n=6, pairPreference = 1, startPalette = list(c(10, -60, 45)), output = 'hex')</a>

<p><img src="intro_files/figure-html/colorgorical2-1.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>To get a starting palette from an R or hexadecimal value, try <span class="pack">col2lab</span>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/col2lab.html">col2lab</a></span>(<span class="st">'dodgerblue'</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-2" data-line-number="2">            L      a.x        b</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-3" data-line-number="3">[<span class="dv">1</span>,] <span class="fl">59.30679</span> <span class="fl">9.612098</span> <span class="fl">-63.4918</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>You can check your to see if your chosen color combinations would pass web standards for contrast sensitivity. For example, if you use blue for your hyperlinks and consider it against a white background for a webpage it passes.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb9-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/color_contrast_checker.html">color_contrast_checker</a></span>(<span class="dt">foreground =</span> <span class="st">'blue'</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb9-2" data-line-number="2">  ratio   AA AALarge  AAA AAALarge</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb9-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="dv">1</span>  <span class="fl">8.59</span> pass    pass pass     pass</a></code></pre></div>
<p>However, if you consider the background as the surrounding text, perhaps not.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/color_contrast_checker.html">color_contrast_checker</a></span>(<span class="dt">foreground =</span> <span class="st">'blue'</span>, <span class="dt">background =</span> <span class="st">'black'</span>)</a>

<p>However, if you want palettes that are colorblind-safe, print-safe etc., especially for continuous scales, you should use packages like <a href="https://github.com/sjmgarnier/viridis">viridis</a> and <a href="https://github.com/thomasp85/scico">scico</a>.</p>

<p>People often want to (and should) examine correlation matrices as a prelude to modeling. One problem is that it is difficult to make much sense from the matrix when there are more than a few columns in the original data, as there are too many pairwise values present. However a little reshuffling of the rows/columns, and visually depicting the values by color can make patterns pop out quickly.</p>
<p>You have plenty of options for this sort of endeavor, such as corrplot, psych, and heatmaply. However, they offer only static plots or reorder based on a cluster analysis. I originally had <a href="https://github.com/m-clark/heatR">a function</a> that would provide some interactivity, but while utilizing a factor analytic approach. Iâ€™ve now deprecated that standalone package and brought the functionality here. The corr_heat function provides an easy way to visualize your correlations.</p>
