<p>Visibly is a handful of functions I use for color palettes, themes, etc. in R. Inside you will find:</p>
<ul>
<li>some ready-made palettes, e.g. based on R blue and Stan red</li>
<li>a function to quickly and easily create palettes with using <code><a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/colortools/topics/complementary">colortools::complementary</a></code> <code><a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/colortools/topics/adjacent">colortools::adjacent</a></code> etc.</li>
<li>clean, web-friendly themes for ggplot2 and plotly</li>
<li>a function to interact with <a href="http://vrl.cs.brown.edu/color/">colorgorical</a>
</li>
<li>coefficient plots for fixed and random effects, plotting of GAM results.</li>
</ul>

<p>Visibly is currently in its early stages, so more may be added soon. For some additional palettes for those fond of another time, you might be interested in <a href="https://github.com/m-clark/NineteenEightyR">NineteenEightyR</a>.</p>
